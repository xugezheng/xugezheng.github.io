<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello! Iâ€™m Gezheng, a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Machine Learning group at the University of Western Ontario ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦. Iâ€™m lucky to be co-supervised by Prof. [Boyu Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/borriewang/) and Prof. [Charles Ling](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~xling/). My research focuses on **Transfer Learning**, **Representation Learning**, and **Trustworthy AI**, aiming to tackle challenges in building adaptive and reliable machine learning systems.

Before starting my Ph.D., I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Beihang University ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³ in 2018. Later, I completed dual masterâ€™s degrees at Beihang University and CentraleSupÃ©lec (Paris-Saclay University) ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡· in 2021. During this time, I conducted research in Natural Language Processing under the guidance of Prof. [Wenge Rong](https://wgrong.github.io/).

<!-- `I am currently seeking postdoctoral opportunities where I can further contribute to advancing and reliable machine learning problems.` -->
`Iâ€™m currently looking for postdoctoral opportunities where I can continue exploring exciting problems in machine learning.` Iâ€™d love to bring my experience in transfer learning, trustworthy AI, and interdisciplinary research to a new team working on impactful projects.
