<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hello! I am Gezheng and I'm currently a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the Machine Learning group within the Computer Science Department at the University of Western Ontario🇨🇦, supervised by Prof. [Boyu Wang](https://sites.google.com/site/borriewang/) and Prof. [Charles Ling](https://www.csd.uwo.ca/~xling/). My research focuses on transfer learning, representation learning, and trustworthy AI.

Before pursuing my Ph.D., I obtained a Bachelor of Science degree in Mathematics and Applied Mathematics from Beihang University in 2018. I later completed dual master’s degrees from Beihang University🇨🇳 and CentraleSupélec (Paris-Saclay University)🇫🇷 in 2021, during which I conducted research in natural language processing under the supervision of Prof. Wenge Rong.

`I am currently seeking postdoctoral opportunities where I can further contribute to advancing and reliable machine learning problems.`
